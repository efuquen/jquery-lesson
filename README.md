### Javascript Libraries

* How do we link in Javascript Files?  What does this really do?
* What is a coding library?  Why do we need it?
* Linking and JQuery Library?
* Show an example of some simple JQuery function.
* Make a note of minification.  See if we can show the same function minified?

### Selectors

* Basis of JQuery is easily selecting elements in the DOM and:
  + Performing some operation/modification to them
  + Reacting to some event (not necessarily user generated)
* First we’ll cover the basis of selectors with the $ sign, then tools to change them
* What is the DOM?  Show HTML and a *tree* and how the DOM directly maps to these concepts.
