JQuery Lesson Plan
==================

## FlickrMap Functions Used

* `$(document).ready`
* `$.getJSON`
* `$.each`
* `$(“#id”).append`

## Concepts

* [Javascript Libraries](#javascript-libraries)
* [Selectors](#selectors)

### Javascript Libraries

* How do we link in Javascript Files?  What does this really do?
* What is a coding library?  Why do we need it?
* Linking and JQuery Library?
* Show an example of some simple JQuery function.
* Make a note of minification.  See if we can show the same function minified?
* Open Source - [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* Closed Source, why it's bad and why Javascript encourages open source.

### Selectors

* Basis of JQuery is easily selecting elements in the DOM and:
  + Performing some operation/modification to them
  + Reacting to some event (not necessarily user generated)
* First we’ll cover the basis of selectors with the $ sign, then tools to change them
* What is the DOM?  Show HTML and a *tree* and how the HTML maps to a tree structure.  Emphasize how it is a representation of the actual HTML and how it is possible to manipulate it with Code.
* So, what is this `$` thing really?  Alias for `JQuery`, which is really a function that takes one string argument.
